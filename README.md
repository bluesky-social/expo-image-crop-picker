# Expo Image Crop Tool

An image cropping tool for Expo that allows cropping of the given image. Can be used alongside a library like `expo-image-picker` to provide a more fully-featured cropping experience for users.

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.
